        <h2>MATCHMAKING</h2>
        <ul class="patch-notes-ul">
            <li>Curved all player's elo to separate into the higher tiers (top players should be near purple and bottom players will be in tier 1)</li>
            <li>Add system to punish players who dodge games constantly. Dodging too many times in a short time will result in a 30-minute queue ban</li>
            <li>Temporarily remove auto balancing on team. This is to test if the feature actually balances games or makes it worse.</li>
            <li>[NEW] Change the "bot" 1v1 mode to 2v2, as widely requested. PLEASE NOTE: There is a known issue that the mini map shows the main map and not the practice map. This is hard coded into the client and its removal would have delayed this patch.</li>
            <li>Add "derank protection" which prevents you from deranking from one massive loss. This will make it harder to derank from tiers.</li>
            <li>Add elo probability skew if you have a player disconnect on your team--meaning that for the elo calculation at the end of the game, players with less players will actually be considered disadvantaged.</li>
            <li>Add alt account tracking. Players are only permitted to use one alt account, any additional accounts may result in reset elo and progress as well as a potential ban</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>BALANCE UPDATES</h2>

            <li>Removed AI players</li>

            <li>Decreased speed from 2.8 to 2.7</li>
            <li>[NOTE] CB's ult was not impacted in this patch because the belief is that his tankiness and movement is likely the cause of his strength rather than the ult. We will monitor as the games go on. #dontstandinthecircle</li>
