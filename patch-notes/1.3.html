        <h2>MATCHMAKING</h2>
        <ul class="patch-notes-ul">
            <li>Curved all player's elo to separate into the higher tiers (top players should be near purple and bottom players will be in tier 1)</li>
            <li>Add system to punish players who dodge games constantly. Dodging too many times in a short time will result in a 30-minute queue ban</li>
            <li>Temporarily remove auto balancing on team. This is to test if the feature actually balances games or makes it worse.</li>
            <li>[NEW] Change the "bot" 1v1 mode to 2v2, as widely requested. PLEASE NOTE: There is a known issue that the mini map shows the main map and not the practice map. This is hard coded into the client and its removal would have delayed this patch.</li>
            <li>Add "derank protection" which prevents you from deranking from one massive loss. This will make it harder to derank from tiers.</li>
            <li>Add elo probability skew if you have a player disconnect on your team--meaning that for the elo calculation at the end of the game, players with less players will actually be considered disadvantaged.</li>
            <li>Add alt account tracking. Players are only permitted to use one alt account, any additional accounts may result in reset elo and progress as well as a potential ban</li>
        </ul>
